    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Homework 8, you performed some basic exploratory data analysis (EDA), laying out the thought process that leads to certain modeling decisions. Then, you added a few new features to the dataset, cleaning the data as well in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you will specify and fit a linear model to a few features of the housing data to predict housing prices. Next, we will analyze the error of the model and brainstorm ways to improve the model's performance. Finally, we'll delve deeper into the implications of predictive modeling within the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO) case study, especially because statistical modeling is how the CCAO valuates properties. Given the history of racial discrimination in housing policy and property taxation in Cook County, consider the impacts of your modeling results as you work through this assignment - and think about what fairness might mean to property owners in Cook County.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this homework, you should be comfortable with:\n",
    "- Implementing a data processing pipeline using `pandas`\n",
    "- Using `scikit-learn` to build and fit linear models\n",

    "In Homework 8, you wrote a few functions that added features to the dataset. Instead of manually calling each function to add these features to the dataset, it is best practice to encapsulate all of this feature engineering into one \"pipeline\" function. Defining and using a pipeline reduces all the feature engineering to just one function call and ensures that the same transformations are applied to all data. In this question, we will build a pipeline with the function `process_data_gm`. \n",

It returns two dataframes: `X`, which is our design matrix, and `y` which is the vector containing the observed data. Take a look at [pd.DataFrame.pipe](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pipe.html); you can use this function with each of the tuples passed in through `pipeline_functions`."

    "As you can see, our simple model has already got off to a good start, but there is certainly still a lot of room for improvement to be made -- one simple reason is we have been only utilizing 1 or 2 features (out of a total of 70+) so far! Can you engineer and incoporate more features to improve the model's accuracy? We won't be asking you to provide your answers here, but this would be important going into the next part (also last part wohoo!) of this assignment."

    "It is time to build your own model!\n",

    "Just as in the guided model from the previous question, you should encapsulate as much of your workflow into functions as possible. Your job is to select better features and define your own feature engineering pipeline inside the function `process_data_fm` in the following cell. **You must not change the parameters inside `process_data_fm`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate your model, we will start by defining a linear regression model called `final_model`. Then, we will process training data using your `process_data_fm`, fit `final_model` with this training data, and compute the training RMSE. Then, we will process the test data with your `process_data_fm`, use `final_model` to predict `Log Sale Price` for the test data, transform the predicted and original log values back into their original forms, and compute the test RMSE. See below for an example of the code we will run to grade your model:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the case of the Cook County Assessor’s Office, Chief Data Officer Rob Ross states that fair property tax rates are contingent on whether property values are assessed accurately - that they’re valued at what they’re worth, relative to properties with similar characteristics. This implies that having a more accurate model results in fairer assessments. The goal of the property assessment process for the CCAO, then, is to be as accurate as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the use of algorithms and statistical modeling has real-world consequences, we often refer to the idea of fairness as a measurement of how socially responsible our work is. But fairness is incredibly multifaceted: Is a fair model one that minimizes loss - one that generates accurate results? Is it one that utilizes \"unbiased\" data? Or is fairness a broader goal that takes historical contexts into account?\n",
    "\n",
    "These approaches to fairness are not mutually exclusive. If we look beyond error functions and technical measures of accuracy, we'd not only consider _individual_ cases of fairness, but also what fairness - and justice - means to marginalized communities on a broader scale. We'd ask: What does it mean when homes in predominantly Black and Hispanic communities in Cook County are consistently overvalued, resulting in proportionally higher property taxes? When the white neighborhoods in Cook County are consistently undervalued, resulting in proportionally lower property taxes? \n",
    "\n",
    "Having \"accurate\" predictions doesn't necessarily address larger historical trends and inequities, and fairness in property assessments in taxes works beyond the CCAO's valuation model. Disassociating accurate predictions from a fair system is vital to approaching justice at multiple levels. Take Evanston, IL - a suburb in Cook County - as an example of housing equity beyond just improving a property valuation model: Their City Council members [recently approved reparations for African American residents](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-03-23/chicago-suburb-approves-government-reparations-for-black-residents).\n",

After a lawsuit was filed against the CCAO for producing [“racially discriminatory assessments and taxes,\"](https://harris.uchicago.edu/news-events/news/prof-chris-berry-testifies-institutional-racism-cook-county-property-taxes) the Office decided that these inequities would be best addressed by making the assessment process more transparent to Cook County constituents.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These transparency initiatives include publishing all of the CCAO’s work on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling). By allowing the public to access any updates to the system in real-time, the Office argues that they increase accessibility to a process that had previously been blackboxed - obscured and hidden - from the public. Ultimately, the hope is that, by exposing the inner workings of the CCAO’s property valuation process, the CCAO's assessment results could be publicly verified as accurate and therefore trusted to be fair."
